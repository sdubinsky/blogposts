# Notes on Improving my Fencing Footwork, Part One

A couple months ago, I started recording myself at practice.  Turns out, my footwork was awful.  I started to really break it down and analyze it, and built a practice routine for myself to rebuild my footwork from the ground up.  This is going to be a series of notes on what I've been doing.

## The Problems

The good part of my footwork is that I move pretty easily up and down the strip and I have a collection of tricky patterns I can use.  That's about it.  The bad list is a lot longer.  When I looked at myself fencing, my form looked very off.  I was standing in almost a runner's pose, with both feet facing my opponent.  I was very bad about keeping my feet apart and under me, and I had a tendency to stand up in high-pressure situations.  I couldn't get any power for my lunges, and I was cutting them short because I knew they would fail.

When I moved, my feet glitched and sometimes I would take two steps where I needed one, or step with the wrong foot first.  I had trouble transitioning from bouncing to real advances or lunges.  I would immediately crossover retreat instead of a real retreat, preventing quick changes of direction.  My movement was very up and down, instead of forwards and backwards.

## The Solution

I believe that the single most important element of footwork is the back leg.  If you get that set properly, your footwork will look pretty good.  I focused on bending my leg as much as I could to provide more power for lunges, turning my knee out to make a better platform to push off from, and keeping my weight shifted much more back.  When I get on guard, I go through it step by step: Shift weight back until I can feel my back leg take the load, bend my back leg until I can feel the strain, and then move my feet far enough apart, straighten my back, and relax my shoulders.  It works really well!  After I made that change, I felt much more grounded, and like my lunges were actual threats.

Static positioning is great, but it isn't the whole story.  I also needed to put work into moving, so that I didn't fall into bad habits when my attention shifted.  I thought carefully about how I felt when doing footwork badly, and focused on moving the correct foot first, landing heel first, and pushing forward instead of up and letting myself fall into it - both for advances and for lunges.

## The Routine

Based on those principles, I built myself a practice routine.  I make very sure to get set properly, and that I'm doing every step correctly.  Each of the following sets is in terms of strip-lengths.  Advances up the strip, and retreats back.  Bend your legs as much as you can, even more than you'd do in a bout.  You shouldn't be able to do more than one or two sets before you need a break.

1. Small Steps: 1 set of ministeps.  Take as many steps as you can to do the set.  The more the better.  Aim to get the same number forward as backward.  This is the most effective part of this routine for improving your footwork.  Get these right, and everything else will follow.
2. Speed variations: 2 sets.  Some combination of slow-slow-fast, slow-fast-fast, and similar.  Make sure you're still keeping your feet apart and not galloping when you go fast.
3. Bouncing shadow fencing: 2 sets of shadow fencing, while bouncing and maintaining good form.  Bouncing comes from the ankles and you should just barely be getting off the ground.
4. Transitions from bouncing to real footwork: 1 set.  I had an issue with a smooth transition from bouncing to an advance or a lunge.  I would always add in an extra step just to reset.  You should be able to do it with a minimum of movement.
5. Lunges: 2 sets of 10.  Focus on extending first, landing far in front of you with your front heel, and pushing off through your back heel for all your forward momentum.
6. Advance-lunge: 2 sets of 10.  Focus on chaining them together.  As your rear leg comes forward to finish the advance, use that same motion to slam it into the ground and push off for the lunge.  Don't finish your advance then begin the lunge.
7. Squat lunges: 1 set.  Full squat, lunge from it as low as you can.  Recover forward and repeat.
