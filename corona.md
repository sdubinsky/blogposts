<2020-04-11 Sat> At the end of January, I went on a ski trip to Europe.  At the time, there were some news stories and people were talking about the new coronavirus, but it was confined to China and nobody I knew was expecting it to be a serious problem outside of China.  When I came back in the beginning of February, they were asking at the airport if people had been to China, but nothing more than that.

A month later, it was Purim.   We knew things were getting more serious.  Weddings were limited to 100 guests, max.  There was a lot of talk about banning all large gatherings, and some of the biggest public parties were cancelled.  I still went to my friend's house party, and didn't think much of it.  Netanyahu said in the beginning of April that Purim parties were responsible for a lot of the spread in Israel.  Somewhere around now, Italy was devastated by the virus, and later many pointed back to it as a model of what not to do.

It was also election season.  The third round of elections(in Israel) had just finished up when corona became a major issue, and it threw everything into chaos.  Netanyahu claimed power, just to deal with the crisis, and Gantz(his major opponent) went along with it.  They ended up forming a unity government where Netanyahu stays PM until september 2020(or somewhere around then), then Gantz takes over.

Many people have been accusing Netanyahu of becoming a dictator and taking the opportunity to seize power.  I don't think this is accurate for two reasons: First, Gantz is supporting him, and Gantz is his major opponent.  Second, the restrictions he's put in place are the same things being done worldwide.  Other dictators around the world seem to be taking more advantage of it, such as in Hungary.  Things might have been different if this had come up pre-election instead of post-election.

Also in early March, they started quarantining everyone who flew into Israel for two weeks.  The major impact for this, for me, was my friend Jacob Sacks' wedding.  Originally planned for the end of March, suddenly nobody was going to be out of quarantine in time.  After a lot of scrambling around, they got his sister on an earlier flight, and she promptly quarantined in his fiancee's house for two weeks.  The restrictions were planned to start the 12th, and she missed the cutoff by just a few hours.

Things got much more serious on the 13th.  Israel put in place a number of restrictions.  No gatherings of more than 10 people, everyone needs to stay at least six feet apart, offices should allow nonessential workers to work from home, and similar restrictions.  Fortunately, I worked as a programmer, and it was easy enough for my company to switch to working at home.  Other people were much less lucky.  My auto mechanic friend was immediately out of a job, and several others followed suit, depending not only on whether they could work from home but whether their company could get enough business to keep paying them.  Unemployment claims rose significantly.  Many seminaries and yeshivot stayed open for another week or more, though.

Even then, I wasn't really sure how serious it was.  I thought we would only be shut down for a week, max, then go back in.  I took a monitor from work, and set up a mini home office.  A week later, i went back and got the rest of my stuff, including my other monitor and my office chair, and the next day I set up a more serious home office.  My table was trapped, but I wasn't hosting anyway.

As an introvert, I was very lucky to be living alone.  My prior roommates ranged mostly from "ok" to "incredibly awful" and if I had to be around them all day it would never have ended well.  Without a commute, and with minimal social interaction, I found myself more full of energy than ever before.  I started messaging old friends, one or two a day, just to catch up.

One of them, Emily Jones, was had just finished her phd in biology, so naturally we got to talking about the virus.  It was sobering and informative, and as of this writing remains the best information I've received on the virus.  In summary, it will take a minimum of eighteen months to get a vaccine to the public, due to long-term testing requirements that absolutely cannot be waived.  Until then, we'll have periodic social distancing(stay home as much as you can, stay away from other people).  As hospital load decreases, the restrictions will lift, as hospital load increases, they'll come back.  Or at least that's what we're hoping will happen.  Once a vaccine is found, it should stay good (meaning the virus won't mutate) and coronavirus will be relegated to the status of measles.

According to knowyourmeme.com, the "flatten the curve" meme went viral on march 6th.

One of my other best friends, Nachum matten, was here while his wife was in med school.  They were scheduled to leave in May, but by the end of March were selling everything and trying to get the first flight out.  Even then, by the time they could get a flight El Al had shut down, and they had to reschedule on United.  I was planning on driving them to the airport.  By the time of their flight, that had become illegal.

Jacob did get married, as soon as his sister got out of quarantine.  He had spent most of the time incredibly busy trying to plan everything.  His parents couldn't fly in, so she was the sole family representative.  As of this writing, they have never met their daughter in law.  I was honored to be invited, and wore three hats - I was an eid kesuba, I gave one of the sheva brachot under the chuppa, and I was a shomer yichud.  The rule was 20 people max, in two groups of ten at least five meters apart.  We didn't come close to that.  The wedding party itself was more like 30, and since they hosted the wedding in the park near his wife's house, all the neighbors came to celebrate.  They livestreamed it on facebook until that broke, then on Zoom, but that filled up.  I ended up streaming over whatsapp to two friends.  Towards the end, the cops came, and as soon as the last bracha under the chuppa was said they started chasing people away.  His father-in-law got a long talking-to, but was let off with a warning.

[Trump has badly mismanaged this from the beginning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-response.html).  In January, he was denying it was a problem.  He still refuses to institute nationwide countermeasures like stay-at-home orders, allowing each state to do what it wants.  States that support him get federal support in the form of equipment, states that don't are denied help or given minimal help.  [States that order equipment themselves find that the federal government will seize the equipment on the runway](https://twitter.com/universalhub/status/1245766760042770433), [leading the Massachusetts governor to enlist the help of the New England Patriots and their jet to get the equipment over from China](https://twitter.com/universalhub/status/1245767398822760448).  [The Illinois comptroller had to race to meet some sellers and cut them a huge check](https://twitter.com/NaderDIssa/status/1246232950007627776).

Apparently, the US used to have a top-notch pandemic response team, and Trump disbanded it.  Most of the above has come from Zeynep Tufekci's twitter feed, she's a top notch sociologist.

Wisconsin, and the Republican-led Supreme Court(remember Merrick Garland?) forced its voters to vote in person, exposing thousands of voters to danger and causing many to stay home.  Most polling places were closed, so people had to wait in line for hours.  This was blatant voter suppression.  Nobody knows what will happen in November for the presidential elections.  We should be doing national vote-by-mail, but that would make it too easy for people to vote.

The CDC and the surgeon general were initially anti-mask, which is one of the major ways to improve public safety.  Everyone should wear masks.

There are breadlines in America right now, at soup kitchens and food pantries.  1000 cars, apparently, and more turned away.  Israel had massive egg shortages, partially due to Pesach.

The chareidim are taking the fall in Israel, and I think it's wrong.  Other low-income populations are equally as hard-hit.  Many of the chareidim were breaking the stay-at-home orders, but equally as many Israelis from all walks of life were as well.  Sports groups I was in were still trying to organize games.  There was a mass hug event organized by some hippies.  I saw a picture of Tel Aviv beach on March 21 and it was very full.  Every shabbat I saw kids and parents outside my apartment just playing or hanging out.  I think the problems in bnei brak were caused by how overcrowded it is more than anything else.  Bnei Brak was closed on about April 3.

I've become much more supportive of universal housing.

There is the usual racism, false information, lies, and misleading statistics.

Israelis were all requested to come home from outside the country on march 19.

Another friend, Tovah Nehrer, was stuck in Australia.  El Al organized a special charter flight, but it filled up too quickly for her to get a spot.  She was stranded for over a week, but eventually made it onto a second charter flight.  For most of that week, she had no idea if or when a flight would come.

On April 1st, even more restrictions went into effect.  Nobody was allowed more than 100 meters from their house, except to go to the grocery store or for medical reasons.  Dedicated runners did mini laps, as did dog walkers.

On the first night of pesach, Israel went into complete lockdown.  It was illegal to leave your house.  This was the culmination of weeks of pushing people to stay home, and not go visit their parents or invite families over.

I'm fortunate in that my mother has a Ph.D in biology of her own, and therefore understands the risks, and is less likely than other people her age to ignore the stay-at-home orders.

It's a bit of a shock every time I find out someone is in full quarantine from potentially being in contact with a contagious person.

Everyone is hiding or underreporting death totals.

Companies and governments are making policy changes to make life easier in response to the pandemic, and the response I've seen has been a lot of "see?  They could do this the whole time and chose not to!"  Which doesn't follow.  They could be losing money on this, and are choosing to try to be nice.

<2020-04-21 Tue>Sweden has apparently decided social distancing, mask wearing, and staying at home aren't necessary, and has an enormous number of deaths as a result.

Stores are limited to a certain number of customers, and the bigger chains will take your temperature before they let you in.

<2020-05-11 Mon>As of the beginning of May, restrictions have been relaxed.  Masks are still required, but businesses and public areas are beginning to reopen and larger groups are allowed.  This is continuing in a gradual rollout over the course of the month.  Universities are reopening in time for final exams.

Masks have become common but not universal, and it's as common to see people wear them on their chin as to see them wear them on their faces.  Equally common, people will carry masks to the stores and only put them on before they go inside.  It's all very frustrating and annoying.  Many businesses support this, at least, by not only refusing entry to unmasked customers but by putting signs out saying things like "if you have a mask?  We're open!  If you don't?  We're closed!"

Israel has done strong social distancing and regulations and kept the death toll low(a few hundred).  New York and Italy(Lombardy) have been strongly hit.  Japan(and other countries) has gotten off easy, according to twitter people(pinboard and patio11) who are there, but hasn't done much in the way of regulations.  Nobody really knows why.
<2020-05-26 Tue>Just about everything has opened up.  Businesses, schools, and so on.  They're still checking temperatures and requiring masks, though.  I learned about a new theory(again from Pinboard) called superspreading theory.  The basic idea is that some people are very contagious and some aren't contagious at all.  [see here.](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/05/why-do-some-covid-19-patients-infect-many-others-whereas-most-don-t-spread-virus-all)

For me, this means it's safer to go outside - it's not just "will I run into someone with covid" it's now also "if I do, are they a superspreader?".  I was also being extra careful so I didn't infect my parents, but now that I've seen them I'm relaxing a little.

<2020-06-03 Wed>Superspreading theory is gaining ground as the most likely theory, which is very relaxing for me.

There is at least one new Ebola outbreak, in the Congo.

In response to another police killing of a black man, George Floyd, on May 25, protests have erupted across America and the world.  The response has been appalling.  Police across america have shot protestors and reporters with tear gas and rubber bullets.  At least one reporter(Linda Tirado) was blinded.  They have driven cars into protestors.  They're covering badges and body cams.

The police have tried to trick protestors and reporters by kneeling for photo ops or to convince protestors to approach, and then tear gassed them.  They've shot rubber bullets and tear gas at children and animals.

Protestors have come prepared with leaf blowers, to blow away tear gas.  In at least one case, police used that as a pretext to fire tear gas.

Protestors have come with water, to wash their eyes out after being pepper sprayed.  Police have confiscated the water, and dumped it out.  People must suffer!

One white supremacist showed up to attack protestors with a bow.  Another with a machete.  Why?  Who knows.  They got their asses kicked.

LA closed their coronavirus testing centers as a punitive response to the protests.

Most governmental officials(with the bright, notable exception of Camden, NJ) have come down on the side of the cops.  Even democratic officials.  They've imposed curfews to curb the protests.  The problem with this is the curfews were announced with no advance notice(within an hour of them taking effect), while public transportation was shut down so there was no way for protestors to leave, and on election days to prevent people from voting.

There has been some property damage and looting, although the vast majority of protests have been peaceful until the police got started.  Some of it has been suburban kids using the protests as cover.  Some of it has been the protestors themselves.  There are two responses.  Those who agree with the protests think the property damage is immaterial next to the constant killings.  Those who disagree with the protests call them rioters and think the looting invalidates the entire protest.  Obviously, property damage isn't nearly as important as people's lives.  Peaceful protest was tried - see Colin Kaepernick - and it didn't work.  So now they got less peaceful protest.  The cops, of course, have focused on the protests instead of the looting.

I'm very glad I got out when I did.  It is, however, intensely frustrating that none of this national response occurs when it's Jews that need defending.

The protests seem to be working.  Most major companies have come out with pro-protest messaging.  Sometimes it's very hypocritical - the NFL put out a statement, after blackballing Kaepernick.  Many major organizations have cut their ties with police departments.  Notably, the University of Minnesota cut ties with the Minneapolis police department.  Other schools have followed suit, which means no more cops in schools.  The Minneapolis city council is looking into disbanding the police department entirely. [Source](https://alphanewsmn.com/minneapolis-city-council/).

In world news, China has used coronavirus as a distraction to try to unofficially annex Hong Kong.  Protests there are continuing, even as the government tries to shut them down.

<2020-07-21 Tue> [Minneapolis](https://twitter.com/NickTagliaferro/status/1285083098468810754), despite previously claiming they were going to defund their police department, has walked it back once the head and public focus is off.

<2020-08-13 Thu> Trump has been making noises about the unreliability of vote-by-mail, despite the clear dangers of voting in person.  More than that, he's been systematically defunding and dismantling the post office in order to prevent voting by mail.  For example, many places are losing their automatic mail-sorting machines: [via vice](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/n7wk9z/the-post-office-is-deactivating-mail-sorting-machines-ahead-of-the-election)

Some places will have ballot drop-off bins set up as an alternative, at least.
<2021-01-06 Wed>So a lot has happened since August.  Things have just felt so surreal and samey that it never seemed worth writing.  Strange to think that was five months ago.  It simulataneously feels like forever ago and last week.  I had to count to make sure it was five months ago.

First, the good news: My sister got married!  She looked lovely, and I'm a big fan of her husband.  I think they make a great pair.

More good news: There's a vaccine!  Several, actually.  One by Pfizer, one by Moderna, and rumor has it that Russia has their own as well.  That came out end of December, better than anyone had hoped for.

Israel has apparently vaccinated a higher percentage of its population than any other country - see [here, by Times Of Israel.](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-still-worlds-best-for-vaccination-but-now-among-worst-for-contagion/).  That says Israel has vaccinated 15.83% of the population, the most in the world by a wide margin.  It's done so by intelligent prioritization, with elderly and sick people getting priority, but also by opening the doors in the evening to anyone who shows up to get the leftover doses.

The US, by contrast, has slowed the rollout in the name of making sure it goes to the elderly and sick first, and has wasted doses to make sure nobody else gets before they do.  Some states even criminalized giving the vaccine to non-priority people.  This is because all the rich donors are old.

That article also says Israel has more cases per million than almost anywhere else.  That's because Israelis just don't care about following the rules, and the politicians are more worried about scoring political points than educating and keeping the population safe.

In China, by contrast, they have almost no cases and are back to normal.  Ask a Republican, and it's because of coercive government control and the American desire for freedom.  Ask a Chinese person (like [Naomi Wu](https://twitter.com/RealSexyCyborg/status/1345997667680206848)), and it's because the Chinese understood the risks, and took some personal responsibility.  If the US government had educated its citizens, things would have been a lot better.  And, of course, if billionaires hadn't forced poor people to go to work in unsafe conditions.  Or if the government had given its citizens enough to live on until a vaccine came out.

Netanyahu, obviously, dissolved the government prior to stepping down, and we're going to have another round of elections in March.  The man has no shame.  I don't know who I'm going to vote for.  They all suck.

Joe Biden won the election under the compelling slogan of "he's not trump."  Many people said "you have to vote for Biden even if you don't like him, because the alternative is worse."  Which is true, I suppose, but that's what they said in 2016.  When will the Democrats put even the slightest bit of effort into politics?  They do nothing but score own goals and give in to the Republicans without getting anything in return.

Along with the presidential elections, there were senatorial campaigns, which I believe the Democrats mostly also won.  In Georgia, they were so close they went to runoff elections, which happened today or yesterday.  There was a massive national outpouring of support, and the Democratic candidates won.  Credit goes to a grassroots network of Black women headed by Stacey Abrams.  One of the candidates Raphael Warnock is Black, and upon his victory said, "Because this is America, the 82-year-old hands that used to pick someone else's cotton picked her youngest son to be a United States Senator."  His opponent ran a racist ad that darkened his skin.  The other winner, Jon Ossoff is Jewish, and *his* opponent ran an ad that enlarged his nose.  See the BBC [here](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-54875344).

In Pennsylvania, the President of the State Senate was removed from his post for refusing to recognize a motion that would have barred a Democratic senator from seat: [see tweet](https://twitter.com/abgutman/status/1346519659005284353)

Back in Hong Kong, using everything else as a cover, they [arrested](https://twitter.com/zeynep/status/1346660199726198785) half of the pro-democracy activists in a major government crackdown.

Trump refused to accep the election results, and has been claiming election fraud since November.  There is a recorded call of him calling up the Georgia governor and asking him to "find extra votes."

As I write this, and scroll through my twitter feed, a group of Trump supporters known as Proud Boys have occupied the Capitol building and are attempting to prevent Biden from taking power.  This is insane.  They are attempting a coup.  Never in my life would I think the US would be dealing with this.  The peaceful transfer of power, no matter what, is one of the absolute cornerstones of the country, ever since George Washington began the tradition.  No matter what happens, when the election is over, you step down.  Trump has been preparing for this for four years by talking about election stealing and prepping his supporters to distrust democrats.

I was wrong.  I thought it would be over in November and everyone else would accept the results, no matter what Trump said.

There is too much to write down to make a coherent story, and also there isn't a coherent story.  Greedy, corrupt people everywhere have conspired to ruin the United States.

There is a conspiracy theory called QAnon.  Probably a troll that started on 4chan, the internet's cesspool, it grew like crazy.  The gist is that there is some sor of entity named Q who is sending secret messages about how Democrats are trying to destroy the country, and Trump is the savior, and will soon crack down on them.  Millions of people believed in it.  This caused them to hate and distrust democrats, hate and distrust anything that told them differently, and form their own closed-off enclaves, which only made things worse.  The information presented to Trump supporters and to non-Trump supporters is almost completely different, and another symptom that exacerbated the problem.

Facebook made it worse so they could make more money off ads.  They knew incendiary content like QAnon stuff drove clicks and advertising, so they engineered the system to promote that as much as possible.  That drew people into fb groups, which became an echo chamber.  What's more, when facebook experimented with cuttin down on the incendiary content, they found out that it mostly affected Republican content, so they stopped doing it.

The Black Lives Matter protestors were met with teargas, rubber bullets, beatings, and arrests.  The Proud Boys were let into the Capitol after the police tried "deescalation and talking to them."  I have video I pulled from @moonddng on twitter that shows the cops literally letting them inside.  Someone has been shot in the Capitol.  Someone set off tear gas.  The Department of Defense refused to send out the National Guard, because they're also Trump supporters.  For the first time ever, the confederate flag made it inside the Capitol.  Nobody will go to jail for this, but they should.

The question has never been "what is legal?"  It has always been "who will enforce the laws?"  And the answer, apparently, is nobody.

What follows is a lightly organized selection of tweets chronicling the event, as they come into my feed.

Biden, at least, has called it what it is: [insurrection](https://twitter.com/alicegoldfuss/status/1346926908160794625).

There is a reported [pipe bomb](https://twitter.com/RepElaineLuria/status/1346890833266683904).  See also [here](https://twitter.com/W7VOA/status/1346923161598763013).

Rep. Cori Bush is calling for the expulsion of the Republican members of congress who incited this: [tweet here](https://twitter.com/RepCori/status/1346926083350794240).

There are also insurrectionists in [Kansas](https://twitter.com/TiffanyKSNT/status/1346905838598967304) and [Georgia](https://twitter.com/GossiTheDog/status/1346901017644953600) and [Oregon](https://twitter.com/MathieuLRolland/status/1346942289084440579).

Ilhan Omar is drawing up [articles of impeachment](https://twitter.com/IlhanMN/status/1346934098384793606).

A secure computer belonging to someone in Nanch Pelosi's office (but probably not Pelosi's computer) was left unlocked, which means the network is no longer secure.  See the pic "pelosiofficecomputer.jpeg".

The woman who was shot [has died](https://twitter.com/NBCNews/status/1346951706056282115).  May her memory be a blessing, and may Hashem avenge her blood.

I'm not seeing any details about what he said, but there are reports trump called for exactly an attack on congress this morning.

The strange b-plot going on right now is that recently a major supply chain attack on the US was discovered.  Someone hacked a company called SolarWinds, which sells a network monitoring program.  While the coup was going on, someone published an article claiming it happened through an "obscure tech company" called JetBrains.  This is funny because JetBrains makes very famous and well-regarded IDEs like pycharm, rubymine, and intelij.  Approximately everyone in the programming world has heard of them.  There is no actual evidence they were hacked, either.

Trump apparently made several tweets inciting further violence and defending the rebels. In a shocking and unprecedented display of good sense twitter deleted them.  He posted a video on fb, and fb deleted the video.

The Capitol has been secured: https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/06/politics/us-capitol-lockdown/index.html .

Mike Braun, Ted Cruz, Josh Rawley, and Cathy Mcmorris Rogers, among others, were planning on objecting to the election results prior to the invasion.  Shameful.

Trump has defended the invasion because he claims the election was stolen.

The media has finally started labeling his lies as lies, which is much too little, much too late.

As an example of the "taught to distrust and hate the media" I mentioned above, "murder the media" was carved into a door in the capitol.

People took [hard drives](https://twitter.com/NicoleArbour/status/1346915051937038336) from computers.

There were on the order of 17 arrests.  Previous, left-wing protests, had on the order of 17,000 arrests.  The man who sat in Nancy Pelosi's office and took her mail walked free.

The capitol has been cleared for a while now, and the gaslighting has started.  "Protestors believed they were allowed to be there, since it's a public building.  Once inside, some got out of control."  This is, to be absolutely clear, not at all what happened.  They climbed walls to get inside.  They made sweatshirts that said "MAGA Civil War."  It has been condemned as an insurrection by both democrats and republicans.

I waited up for hours to see if they would invoke the 25th amendment, but no luck.

<2021-01-07 Thu>Congress has finally officially certified Trump's victory.  Nobody seems to have been censured or punished for aiding and abetting sedition, or questioning the election results.

<2021-01-09 Sat>Twitter has suspended Trump's account.  This was his main method of communicating with the rest of the world, to the point that nobody knows quite what he thinks, since he can't tweet about it anymore.

Similarly, facebook and youtube have moved against right-wing extremist groups.  Some of them.  This is a transparent and obvious ploy to gain favor with the incoming president and his party.

<2021-01-12 Tue> Github, the company best-known for working with ICE, has fired a Jewish employee for warning others that nazis were out in force: [see here](https://outline.com/Mn7BCV), also archived on the wayback machine.

<2021-01-13 Wed>Trump has been impeached a second time, after Mike Pence refused to invoke the 25th amendment.  There are three reasons that I can see:
1. to prevent him doing any further damage.
2. to deny him his post-presidential benefits.
3. to show that this is morally unacceptable.
<2021-02-22 Mon>
Trump was acquitted, after much chatter about the filibuster.  57 voted to convict, but they needed 67.

I got vaccinated, thanks to Israel's lenient "give people leftover vaccines" policy.  The hardest wait of the entire year was the weeks between my first and second shot, when I was so close to being able to go out and about.

<2022-01-19 Wed>Until relatively recently(but time is fake anyway), the pandemic in Israel was going well.  Aggressive inoculations plus strong lockdowns meant we were almost back to normal.  Unfortunately, bad vaccination policies globally meant that in other places it was a lot worse.  This allowed more-infectious variants to evolve and spread.  The first well-known one was Delta, which was kinda funny because of the airline that everyone loved to hate.  It was a problem, but if you were vaccinated it was mostly fine.  It was kind of random - I was at one wedding with heavy covid protocols, but the bride, groom, and a lot of his family got it.  I was at another with a bunch of unvaccinated people (didn't find out until I got there) and nobody got it that I heard of.

In retrospect, them rolling out a third shot (second booster) should've been more of a warning, but maybe not.  Mine was the most Israeli experience - showed up on floor -4 of a parking lot to wait in a very disorganized vaccination center.  And then we were fine, and life went on.

A couple months ago, another new variant popped up - Omicron.  It's incredibly infectious, and vaccines aren't nearly as effective against it.  Suddenly, it seems like everyone is getting it.  There's a tweet making the rounds about not getting covid feeling like being in middle school dodgeball in the back - and the front lines have thinned.  It's very relatable.  A sense of nihilism has set in generally.  Everyone assumes everyone will get it, so nobody is caring as much.  Masks seem to have stuck around, at least, but everyone is a lot less careful with them.  A lot of over-the-nose and under-the-chin, even from store workers.

This variation of the pandemic is definitely the one hitting close to home.  Coworkers, friends, family are all getting it.  Thankfully, vaccines decrease the severity if you do get it, in addition to decreasing the likelihood of you getting it.

They're offering fourth shots to the elderly.  There's some talk that we'll end up needing a yearly booster, just like the flu shot.

I feel so much undirected anger, both personally and from my peers.  There's so much wrong that has led to this, and it's stuck so deep into the bones of the world, it seems impossible to fix.  I know it's not, and I know the answer is not to fix all of it but to take a chunk of it, but it still feels overwhelming.  I'm ashamed to realize that if I were alive 100 years ago, I would not be a striker. I guess as a programmer my best option is to just dump a bunch of money into causes championed by people who do have what it takes.

I keep thinking back to the beginning.  I thought it would be over in two weeks, after the original lockdown.  Then I thought it would be over when a vaccine came out.  Then I realized how badly world governments were mismanaging everything, and now, who knows?  I'm leaving the country for the first time since then, because this is the new normal.  For a long time I've felt that politics is the art of getting people to do what you want them to, except the avenue politicians have chosen is to demand it by virtue of who they are, or who they aren't.  They've lost the ability to gain support any other way, and it shows.  Politicans ought to be the best at convincing people to wear masks and get a vaccine, but they're using it to score political points instead.

<2022-02-24 Thu> Putin invaded Ukraine today.  He's been leading up to this for months, and it's escalated rapidly since shortly before the Olympics happened.  The good side is, the general Russian populace seems to be heavily against it.  There are many protests all over Russia, and the Russian stock market tanked so badly they had to close the exchange.  The bad side is, they fucking invaded Ukraine.  You'd think, what with the pandemic, world leadership would focus on that, but nope!  What Putin wants, Putin tries to get.  I don't know enough of what's going on to really comment, but it seems like Ukraine needs and deserves a lot of help, and what it's getting is a lot of diplomatic posturing.  And some sanctions.

What complicates things is that international fencing is owned by Alisher Usmanov, a Russian oligarch who directly benefits from the invasion.  So now all of fencing feels even more tainted than before, because we're bankrolled by blood money.  But what can we do?

<2022-03-06 Sun> The Ukrainians are holding on better than anyone expected, and Russia is cratering.  Donations are pouring in from both private individuals and governments (war material, not troops as yet).  The Russian military, it turns out, is riddled with corruption and therefore undertrained and poorly equipped, and what equipment it does have is broken and unmaintained.

It's been very interesting to observe the information aspect of this.  This is the first war of its kind fought in the modern internet era, and it's clear Russia was not prepared for it.  Russia has gone back to the standard playbook of shutting off large parts of the internet, shutting down independent media, and broadcasting pure lies to its citizens, many of whom believe it.  But they can't control the information flow that way anymore.  There are many ways around the internet blockade both technically(tor, etc.) and culturally.  There was a quote when I was younger "the internet views censorship as damage, and routes around it" and that attitude is on full display.  People are posting pro-Ukraine posts everywhere they can, in places you'd never expect, like Yelp reviews.

More than that, everyone has a cell phone now.  Broadcasting that the war is going great, or that there is no war, or anything else doesn't work when every soldier is texting their moms that they're not actually in Donbas, they're not really on a training exercise, they're not being welcomed with open arms, and in fact they're getting their asses handed to them.

Ukraine has really leaned into this.  They have many ad campaigns out aimed directly at Russian mothers.  The most notable of these is an offer to release Russian POWs to their mothers, if the mothers come in person.

Zelenskyy, the PM of Ukraine, has shown himself to be a man of astonishing personal courage and leadership.  He and his family have stayed behind in Kyiv, and is posting videos regularly showing himself among the fighting and the regular people.  They play extremely well in the West, and he's built himself a real cult of personality.  This is exactly what he needs to do - people love him, people write into their congresspeople, congress sends him aid, he wins.

In a more local sense, the free flow of information means people are aware of what's happening in Russia.  Protests have erupted all over Russia, even in the face of Putin's crackdowns.  In the West, people see this and realize it's not the fault of the Russian people.  There is a sense of sympathy for them that I think didn't exist in e.g. the Bush wars.  The Russians outside of Russia have also been eager to distance themselves from Putin.  In fencing, all nations announced their intention to withdraw from international competition rather than fence the Russian squad - so the Russian squad withdrew instead.  This can't be easy for them, and that was an extremely classy move.

Also fencing-related, Usmanov is out, at least temporarily, following international sanctions against him.  This is good in the sense that he's remarkably evil, frustrating in the sense that now someone else equally bad is probably going to step in.  It's nice that he's gone, but the problem won't really be solved until fencing figures out how to protect itself against being used for reputation laundering.  Still, this is a nice step and anyway the perfect is the enemy of good.
