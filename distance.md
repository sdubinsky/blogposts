# Distance in Fencing

## Introduction
Distance and tempo are the keys to modern fencing(and in fact the keys to all sports), yet they are such nebulous concepts that it's hard to really understand what they are, or how to use them properly.  Or even where one ends and the other begins.

For the purposes of this discussion, we're assuming that you and your opponent have perfect technique.  We'll talk about the relative importance of technique another time.  Most of this discussion will also  center around two fencers who are approximately the same height, with the same reach.  We'll talk about major height differences at the end.

## Four Distances
There are, more or less, four categories of distances you need to worry about.  From closest to furthest away, they are:

1. Infighting distance 
2. single tempo distance
3. Two tempo distance
4. Out of distance

Infighting distance is when you're standing right next to your opponent.  This is generally a high-variance situation best avoided unless you really love infighting.  There's not much advice here that translates well to other situations, so I'll leave it at this:  In infighting, the winner is the one who makes the first correct action.  Don't blindly poke at your opponent, you're more likely than not to miss and lose the touch.

Out of distance is when you're so far away, nothing your opponent can do will threaten you and nothing you can do will threaten your opponent.  No fencing possible here, but it's a good space to be in for relaxing and catching your breath.  Don't be afraid to break distance and get away for a bit.

Single tempo distance is when you're close enough that you can score in a single tempo, such as with a fast lunge or a quick hand shot.  If you're in single-tempo distance and not already doing anything else, you have won the touch(or at least earned a double).  If you're in single-tempo distance and your opponent isn't doing anything else, you've lost the touch.

Two-tempo distance is where most fencing occurs.  This is the distance where your opponent has time to react to a single-tempo action.  A simple lunge at this distance will get you parry-riposted.  The goal here, basically, is to get yourself within single-tempo distance.

## What's in a Distance?
The distances listed above aren't simple distances you can measure on the ground.  You can't say "I can lunge three feet, so that's my single-tempo distance."  It does depend on your lunge distance, but there's more to it.  Some elements change from bout to bout, some change from touch to touch, some change from moment to moment. It can even change without either fencer really moving their feet.  For example, a small feint won't necessarily move me close enough to score.  But if my opponent bites, all of a sudden he needs a lot more time to deal with my real attack, and I might be in single-tempo distance without taking a step.  On a longer time scale, practicing parries and getting smaller parries will allow you to wait longer before you have to take a parry, effectively allowing you to fence closer to your opponent.

## Practical Applications
As a rule, the best place to fence is right on the border between the single-tempo and two-tempo distance, just barely on the two-tempo side.  This will let you punish your opponent's mistakes and make threatening, believable feints.

There's lots you can do in this position to try to score.  The simplest is probably trick your opponent into thinking you're in two-tempo distance when you're really in one-tempo distance.  Then you can just hit them.  The simplest way to do this is with footwork.  Constant movement, differently sized and differently timed steps, half-steps, half-lunges, all that good stuff.  You can also feint and pressure your opponent easily, because every action you do moves you into single-tempo distance.  If your opponent does nothing, he's letting you hit him.  If he doesn't respond correctly(and there are a number of possible correct responses), you've earned your touch.

The opposite is equally possible and equally useful.  When you're right on the border, you can also trick your opponent into thinking he's in single-tempo distance when he's really in two-tempo distance.  Then he'll attack, and you can score on the riposte.  You can do this with baits and false openings, and obviously tricky footwork designed to confuse your opponent, like above.

If your opponent is less than perfect, this might change.  A timid fencer means you can move into single-tempo distance with impunity, and an overly aggressive fencer might mean you can bait from farther within two-tempo distance and still get results.

## Improving Distance
Three parts of distance are under your control.  You can control your effective distance, your knowledge of your effective distance, and your knowledge of your opponent's effective distance.

Increasing your effective distance is all about working hard.  Get in better shape, practice your technique, stretch.  If you fence a lot while doing this, you'll get a good sense of how far away you can be and still score in a single action.

Getting a better sense of what your opponent's effective range is much more complicated.  Pretty much, you have to fence them a few times to really understand it.

## Large Height Differences
Up until now, we've been assuming that both fencers are the same height.  That's not always the case, especially in mixed events.

Being much shorter than your opponent invalidates many of the above assumptions.  For example, defensive single-tempo distance and offensive single-tempo distance are no longer the same - someone the same height as their opponent can reliably parry-riposte, but while a significantly shorter fencer might be able to parry, they might be unable to riposte because they're still too far away.

On the plus side, as a shorter fencer you can still be in normal fencing distance when your opponent feels uncomfortable and wants to switch to infighting distance.

So next time you fence, pay attention to how far you are from your opponent not in terms of feet, but in terms of actions needed to get a touch.
