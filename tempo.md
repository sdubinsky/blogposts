# Tempo in Fencing

## Introduction
Distance and tempo are the keys to modern fencing(and in fact the keys to all sports), yet they are such nebulous concepts that it's hard to really understand what they are, or how to use them properly.  Or even where one ends and the other begins.

For the purposes of this discussion, we're assuming you and your opponent have perfect distance and technique.  We'll talk about those later.

## Tempo: A Definition
In a nutshell, tempo is the time it takes you to decide to do an action, complete the action, and return to a state where you can do something else.  For example, when you stick your arm out and lunge, you're unable to do anything else until your front foot hits the ground.  That's a tempo.  The key here is commitment to an action.  One tempo is the amount of time you spend committed to an action.

Not all tempos are created equal.  Some are faster than others, and this is mostly dependent on how big the action is.  Big actions, like lunges or wild parries, are big commitments and long tempos.  Small actions, like blade presses, are smaller commitments and quicker tempos.

If you were to lay out a timeline of a bout, and make a mark every tempo(every time someone committed to an action), you would get something Ringo could drum to.  This is what people mean when they talk about the tempo of a bout.  If Ringo plays quickly, it's an up tempo bout.  If Ringo plays slowly, it's a low tempo bout.

## Using Tempo to Score
Using tempo to score is really simple.  Just find the times when your opponent is committed to an action, and do something that beats that action.  If your opponent is lunging, parry-riposte.  If your opponent is parrying, disengage-lunge.  My coach used to talk about being a half-tempo ahead.  This is a state where you've finished whatever you're doing while your opponent is still responding.  For example, you feint, and your opponent is late on the attempted parry, so you have time to disengage before he can finish the parry.

Simple isn't easy, though.  Why would your opponent commit to an action without being sure it would hit?  This is where most of the rest of fencing comes in - feints, baits, distance games, and the like.

But feints and baits require commitments of their own, and every time you commit you give your opponent an opportunity to hit you.  So how can you commit to anything?  Why isn't fencing just two people staring at each other for four minutes?

Shut up, sabreurs.

There's two parts to the answer.  One is that you wait for your opponent to be out of  position to punish you.  He might be committed to his own action.  He might not be able to react in time, if it's a small enough  commitment.  But a prep that doesn't draw a reaction from your opponent isn't very useful, and if he's otherwise occupied you might as well just hit him.

The other is more interesting.  You disguise your tempo.  Commit small, but make your opponent think you're committing big.  This is what they really mean when they say "make your feints believable."  When you convince your opponent you're lunging, but you cut the lunge short, so he throws out a big parry, but you're already ready to disengage?  That's one way to win using tempo.
